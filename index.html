            <p>My name is Tamanna.I am new here. I love backing and decorating cakes. This is such a great platform to
                learn more new techniques of decoration and new ideas.
                Thank you all.After three years of dental practice, Cake Artistry became my new high and I began to
                self-train in baking and cake decorating. It has been two years since I began my venture and this
                dynamic field never fails to intrigue me. Working on creations that involve extensive hand painting and
                sculpting with textures in Royal icing are my best loved mediums.
                I am currently catering to Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia and I really look forward to meeting new
                artists on this platform.</p>
